Second version to tackle the problem

With initial data that only has one z plane of cubes
After each generation the planes surrounding this initial z plane is symmetrical in value

From the example we can see

Before any cycles:

z=0
.#.
..#
###

After 1 cycle:

z=-1
#..
..#
.#.

z=0
#.#
.##
.#.

z=1
#..
..#
.#.

Note that plane z = -1 and z = 1 are the same.

Store the grids in a 3 dimensional array such that Cube[][][].

After each generation we consider the z = 0 plane separately as it depends on the value of z = 1 plane twice. When x != 0 and x != zMax (z = 0...x...zMax) these planes can x-1 and x+1 to
find what cubes are active.
